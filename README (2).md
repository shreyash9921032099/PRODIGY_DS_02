# 🛳 Titanic EDA 

This repository contains my data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset.

## 📂 Dataset Used
[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## ✅ Tasks Performed
- Cleaned null values from `Age`, `Embarked`
- Dropped column `Cabin` due to high missing percentage
- Created features: `FamilySize`, extracted `Title` from `Name`
- Analyzed survival trends based on class, gender, fare, and age
- Visualized patterns using seaborn & matplotlib
- Created a correlation heatmap for numeric features

## 📊 Key Insights
- Females had significantly higher survival rates than males
- Passengers in 1st class had better survival odds than 2nd or 3rd
- Higher fare correlated with greater survival probability
- Medium-sized families survived more often
- Social titles (like Mr, Miss, etc.) highlighted survival patterns
